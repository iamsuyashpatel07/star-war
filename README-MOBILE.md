### Our tech stack
We use the following technologies: TypeScript, React Native, styled-components, Redux and Jest.

### Challenge Background
We love Star Wars! Who doesn't love Star Wars!? We would like to know more about its planets.

Help us create a dashboard using the data from `planets-ui.json` to better visualize Star Wars's planets.

### Technical requirements
1. You need to create a mobile only application displaying a list of planet cards using the json mentioned above.
2. Each card should contain the following data:
   * `name`
   * `terrain`
   * `climate`
   * `population`
   * `residents` (Number of known residents)

3. The data needs to be filterable and sortable as follows:
   * The user should be able to filter by `name` using a text field.
   * The user should be able to filter by `climate` using a dropdown field.
   * The user should be able to filter by `terrain` using a multiselect dropdown field.
   * The user should be able to sort data by `name`, `population` and `residents`.

Bonus.
1. Are you part of the dark side and cannot live without a dark theme? Let's make it!
2. Are you an old master that cannot process 60 planets at once? Let's add a pagination to remove noise from the Dashboard!

### Challenge requirements

1. Avoid UI libraries as much as possible and implement your own utilities, styles and UI components.
   * For example, we want the filter components implemented from scratch.
   * Copying in totality or partially a library is considered as using a UI library.
2. Know that a cleaner and high quality submission is worth more than a feature complete, but messy one.
3. Remember that as UI engineers, UIs are an integral part of our lives and good-looking UI is as important as a well functioning one.
4. Try to treat this as the base for an enterprise application. How do you setup state, business logic and code structure in your ideal application?
5. Feel free to choose any React Native stack that can accomplish these requirements.
6. Have fun and get creative!

### Submission
1. Please include instructions on running your solution locally.
2. Please include a screen capture of your solution, so we can assess whether there is UI differences between your environment and ours.
